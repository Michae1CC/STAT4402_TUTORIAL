% Describe the problem you are solving.  This does not need to be very in depth but should provide the reader with any 
% information they need in order to understand what you are doing.
% You can cite references but we are after *your* statement of the problem not a copy paste from elsewhere.

% Describe your implementation.   This should not be a copy of your source code but should have enough detail to allow the 
% reader to understand how your program works. You should definitely describe any data structures you have employed as well as any 
% optimisations you have attempted.

% Describe how you know that it works.  This applies to both the correctness and performance. "I tested it with a few cases" 
% would be a low quality answer. How many test cases? Why those cases?  If you used optimisations, did they work? (Both in 
% terms of preserving correctness and actually improving performance).

% Description of performance. (Note that this is a bit more flexible than what is listed in the ECP).  What can you say about the performance 
% of your implementation? How does the run time vary with different inputs? You can also include content about 
% profiling or internal timing analysis you have done here.
